# X-Ray-Covid-Classification
The Dataset used is [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset)
Improving COVID-19 detection using just Chest X-rays.
This repository includes source code of deep learning model for classification between Viral Pneumonia,COVID, and the healthy on chest X-ray image. The detail of the model is described in our paper (Automatic classification between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy on chest X-ray image
Our results show that the three-category accuracy of the model was 95% between COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and the healthy.
